<br><br>As a private practitioner, I am registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office and I abide by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means that I need to tell you what personal data I am collecting from you and how I process it. Please see the details outlined below.
<br>
<br>In line with the principles of GDPR, I aim to record as little personal information about you as possible. Your personal data collected includes:
<br>•	Name, date of birth, address, phone number, email address.
<br>•	Dates of contacts, appointments and attendances.
<br>•	A record of the information provided, including; life events, family and medical history, etc.
<br>•	Brief session summary.
<br>•	Contact details of your next of kin and professionals responsible for your welfare (GP, Social Worker, etc.).
<br>
<br>Why your personal data is collected and processed:
<br>•	To establish clear understanding of your life circumstances, views, interests and needs.
<br>•	To provide you with the as effective service possible.
<br>•	To protect you from any harm.
<br>•	To meet the legal obligations.
<br>
<br>How your data is collected:
<br>•	From the referral: by telephone, email, letter, etc.
<br>•	From the initial consultation  
<br>•	From each art therapy session
<br>•	Artwork created in the sessions
<br>•	Correspondence between the sessions, through telephone and emails.
<br>
<br>How your data is stored: 
<br>Any written data is stored securely in an encrypted electronic format in a password protected system. No paper file will be kept. The data will be retained in a separate encrypted password protected system for 7 years after the completion of the therapy. I do not store telephone numbers on my phone. Between therapy sessions, my preference is for communication via email. You can read Gmails data policy here. Hue animation software is sometimes available for us to use during art therapy sessions. Here is their privacy policy. 
<br>
<br>Within in-person art therapy, your artwork created in the sessions is stored safely the art therapy studio, with no unauthorised access, during the course of the therapy. In order to monitor the therapy’s progress, the artwork is photographed each session or in the case of online therapy, I request a screenshot of your art work. Digital images are stored in an encrypted secure password protected system during the course of therapy. At the end of the art therapy, you will decide what you wish to do with your artwork. If disposal is your choice, I will follow your instruction to dispose it confidentially. Any digital images will be deleted from the system.
<br>
<br>Online Appointments:
<br>If we see each other online, I use Zoom as a secure platform for videocalls. You can read Zoom’s GDPR policy here. Our meeting link will not contain any identifiable information. You do not need to have an account to join the zoom meeting.
<br>
<br>Data sharing:
<br>Please note that I will never share your data with any third party without your request or consent, except in statutory safeguarding cases. There are limited circumstances in which I might also need to share your information which could include:
<br>•	In the case of any unforeseen incident occurring that would prevent me from contacting you, I have instructed a colleague (Bisha Mistry – HCPC registered art psychotherapist) to access my active client file (with your name and email address - only), so that you would be informed of the situation. 
<br>•	with the relevant authority such as the police or a court, if necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which I am subject e.g. a court order.
<br>•	with the police or a local authority for the purpose of safeguarding children or vulnerable adults.
<br>•	with my regulatory body HCPC, my insurance provider and/or solicitor in the event of a complaint, claim, investigation or legal proceedings being brought against me.
<br>•	Clinical supervision is essential for the safe delivery of therapy. I discuss my clinical work with an experienced clinical supervisor. Identifiable information is not shared as part of this meeting. 
<br>
<br>Financial data:
<br>I keep financial information including bank statements for 7 years as advised by HMRC. Please be aware, as a self-employed art therapist, invoices are evidence of my income and these must be declared to HMRC annually. If you pay me via BACS, please be aware that your account name and reference may be viewed by employees of the bank.
<br>
<br>Your rights: 
<br>Please note that you have the rights:
<br>•	To have data about you deleted.
<br>•	To have inaccurate personal data corrected.
<br>•	To object or restrict the data being processed by legitimate interest.
<br>•	To object to decisions being taken by automated means.
<br>•	To request the data to be transferred to another organisation by legitimate interest. 
<br>•	To request to access your personal data and information about processing of it.
